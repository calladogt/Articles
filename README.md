# Research internship
## Deep-learning pour la modélisation de systèmes dynamiques chaotiques

I will describe my research internship here. The research subject is "Deep learning to modelization of chaotic dynamics systems".

For instance, I will separate 2 folders of files: articles and codes. In the article folder, I will put all articles that make sense to read and study about my research project. In codes, I will store all codes made during my internship.
