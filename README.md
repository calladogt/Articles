# Research internship
## Subject: Deep learning to the modeling of chaotic dynamics systems

The objective of this research internship is to develop and evaluate some models of Deep learning to the prediction of chaotic systems. The experimental framework will be based on simple systems capable of simulating complex phenomena: the Lorenz attractor in 3D and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky.

All the files produced and used in this internship will be stored here. I'm gonna separate all these files into 3 folders: articles, codes and report. In the article folder, I will put all articles that make sense to read and study about my research project. In codes, I will store all codes made during my internship. For the last one, I'm gonna to write my report there.
